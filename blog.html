            <article class="">
                <p>CSS has several different units for expressing a length such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc. <br> Length is a number followed by a length unit. There are two types of length units: absolute and relative.

                    <br> <br>
                   <strong> Absolute Lengths </strong>
                   <br> <br>
                    The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size. <br>
                    Absolute length units are not recommended for use on-screen, because screen sizes vary so much. However, they can <br> be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.
                    I.e cm, mm, in, pt, pc …etc
                    <br> <br>
                     
                   <strong> Relative Lengths</strong>
                      <br> <br>
                    
                    Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scales better between <br> different rendering mediums. I.e px,%,em,em,ex …etc
                    The px unit is the magic unit of CSS. It is not related to the current font and usually <br> not related to physical centimeters or inches either. The px unit is defined to be small but visible, and such that a horizontal <br> 1px wide line can be displayed with sharp edges (no anti-aliasing)
                    The px is thus not defined as a constant length, but as <br> something that depends on the type of device and its typical use. 
                    it is more recommended
                    The em and ex units depend on the font and may be different for each element in the document. The em is simply the font size. <br> In an element with a 2in font, 1em thus means 2in. Expressing sizes, such as margins and paddings, in em means they are related to the font size, and if the user <br> has a big font (e.g., on a big screen) or a small font (e.g., on a handheld device), the sizes will be in proportion. Declarations such as text-indent: 1.5em and margin: 1em are extremely common in CSS. 
                    <br><br>
                    The rem (for “root em”) is the font size of the root element of the document. Unlike the em, which may be different for each element, the rem is constant throughout the document..</p>

                <p class="title"> How does the browser interpret 200px</p>
                <article class="">
                    <p>The font size or text size is how large the characters displayed on a screen(which are browsers)or printed on a page are. if we are going to change the font-size  of the Default font size of the HTML we can use font size of the CSS properties <br>. since Font-size is CSS properties. but till we specified the font size of the HTML root element the default value is 16px. 
                        so the Interpretation, if we assign the font size, width, height of HTML element like 200px,  the browser will Interprete it as follows 16px=100%, <br> so what is 200px in termes of percent then again recalculated it by 16px. 
                       so the it will 200px to 200*100%/16. 
                       </p>

                    <p class="title">  Specific changes in css3</p>
                    <article class="">
                        <p> <br><br>
                            <strong> 1. CSS Animations and Transitions </strong> <br> <br>
                            CSS animations are finally available in all major browsers. There are two ways to create CSS animations. <br> The first is very easy, it is done through animating the changes of CSS properties with the transition declaration. With transitions, <br> you can create hover or mouse down effects
                            The second way for defining animations is a bit more complicated - it involves the description of specific moments <br> of the animation with the code>@keyframe rule. This allows you to have repeating animations that don't depend on user actions
                         <br><br>  <strong> 2. Calculating Values With calc() </strong> <br> <br>
                             It allows you to do simple arithmetic calculations in CSS. You can use it anywhere a length or a size is required. <br> What is even cooler, is that you can freely mix different units, like percentages and pixels. This makes a lot of layout hacks that you might have used in the past obsolete. 
                           <br><br> <strong> 3. Advanced Selectors </strong> <br> <br>
                            These days, if you assign IDs to elements only so you can style them, you are probably doing it <br> wrong. CSS 2.1 and CSS 3 introduced several powerful selectors that can make your layouts cleaner, and your stylesheets more awesome.
                          <br> <br> <strong> 4. Generated Content and Counters </strong> <br> <br>
                            Generated content is a powerful tool in the hands of developers, made available by the:: before and:: <br> after pseudo-elements. This feature lets you use less HTML to achieve the same layouts. This is especially beneficial in cases where you need extra box <br> shadows or other visual elements that would require extra spans or divs. In the end, you get a more minimal and semantically correct HTML.
                             
                         <br><br> <strong>  5. Gradients </strong> <br> <br>
                            Gradients give web designers the power to create smooth transitions between colors without having to <br> resort to images. CSS gradients also look great on retina displays, because they are generated on the fly. They can be linear or radial and can be set to repeat.
                            
                            
                         <br><br> <strong>  6. Border Images </strong>  <br><br>
                            The border-image property allows you to display custom-designed borders around elements. The borders are <br> contained in a single image (sprite), with each region of that image corresponding to a different part of the border.
                         <br><br>  <strong> 7. Media Queries </strong> <br><br>
                            Media queries are an absolute must if you are serious about web design. They have been around for a while, <br> but are worth a mention because they have transformed the way we build websites. It used to be that you had a regular website, wide enough to fit the smallest monitor resolution used at the time, and a separate mobile website.
                          <br><br> <strong> 8. Multiple Backgrounds </strong> <br><br>

                            With multiple backgrounds, designers can achieve very interesting effects. They can stack different images <br> as backgrounds of the same element. Each image can be moved and animated independently like you can see in the demo below. All background-related CSS rules can now take a comma-delimited list of properties.</p>
